# `vite build` rather than `npm run build`, which also runs `tsc --noEmit`. Type-checking here
# would drag in the server's own type graph — ws.ts type-imports store.ts, which imports db.ts,
# which imports `pg` — and module resolution starts at /src/server/, where no node_modules exists.
# Value imports are unaffected: esbuild erases `import type` outright, so the bundle never reaches
# db.ts. Types are CI's job (see .github/workflows/ci.yml), where the full workspace is installed.

# `pg` is the server's ONLY third-party dependency — everything else it imports is a node: builtin.
# It sits in devDependencies because the npm package ships the CLI alone, and putting it in
# dependencies would make every `npx control-claude-code` user download a database driver they
# never load. Reading the range back out of package.json keeps the two from drifting apart.
# --no-save matters as much as the version lookup: with `pg` sitting in devDependencies, a plain
# `npm install pg` keeps it filed under dev, which any production-mode install then skips —
# silently, leaving a green build that dies at startup with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND.
